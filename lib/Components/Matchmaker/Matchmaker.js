  // TODO When we implement multiple players per request
  // it should be enough to just change the size in inc
  // and use $each to add multiple requests. So one request will need to be
  // copied to one for each player in the request.
  //
  // And for the query part, all requests need to match.
  // However, for roles, it is not possible to match a group of players
  // with another match. This is because we don't change the state of the query
  // for possible delegation and the next role check would use an invalid state.
  // So for roles we have to just create the match and let other users join.
  // We may still be able, though, to create a seperate algorithm for matching
  // groups with roles with other existing matches.
  //
  // Remember, that when we try to match a group of players, we have to make sure
  // that the players actually match with eachother or it will not find a match
  // so a match is created that may not be matchable with other users. We should
  // test for this so the the client does not have to and send an appropriate error.

  // TODO Implement removal of requests from matches.

  // TODO Add a worker to make matchmaking requests on behalf of the client with
  // otpimal delays before creating the match. The reason for this is because
  // we don't want to put more logic than necessary on the client. Until we've found
  // a match we should just respond with the request and it's attributes. By doing this
  // we can use locks if we want to, however, locks will still affect performance badly.
  // This poses architectural problems. It this reliable? What happens if the server goes down?
  //
  // This is also an apportunity to send matchmaking requests to multiple matcmaking servers for the game
  // so that we can reach greater scale.

  // TODO Implement handlers/hooks for some actions. For instance, matchCreated,
  // playerLeft, etc. So if a player leaves the match, it could be penalized or something.
  // This is maybe not necessary though since much of it could be done on the client.
  // Still we would need some things like setPropertyIfNotSet to set a selected multiplayer
  // server.
